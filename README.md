### Hi there 👋

You have found my ✨ _secret_ ✨ Github page. Here is a vegan cookie: 🍪

I cannot imagine what kind of wizardry you performed to reach this page, but man, I am impressed.
So impressed you deserve a second cookie: 🍪
Pro Tip: Don't eat them both at once, your tummy might go upset.

Anyways, back to business. You probably didn't come here to eat cookies and get compliments on your search skills.
Probably you came here to check out my code... Well, all my code is private with the exception of some really old 8 years and older repos.

But *HOLD ON* Nick!??? I understand that active work repositories are off limits and thus private, but surely not the open source ones?!!!

You are 100% right and I should HIRE YOU for being so quick and sharp minded. However, when I am making open source contributions,
then I fork the project, create a pull request and as soon as that has been merged I delete the fork. The reason is simple. In the 
past, I did not such thing and my GitHub was littered with stale forks, months to years old... 
Believe me that is not a pretty sight! AND a waste of precious diskspace! We all have to be a little more green, and if I can help
my dear friends at GitHub to save a couple of MBs of disk space I am all for that.

## I can see that you are impressed.
In fact, so impressed that you might want to check out some more information of yours truly at the following location:

With this I salute you,
🙏

Your best of friends,
